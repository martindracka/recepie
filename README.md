# 🍽️ Recipe Page – My First Web Project
Welcome to my very first coding project! This is a simple but meaningful recipe webpage that I built using HTML and CSS. The main goal of this project was to start learning the basics of web development — everything from writing clean HTML structure to styling with CSS.

## 💡 What I Learned
How to create and structure a webpage using semantic HTML

How to style elements using CSS, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout

Basics of responsive design, making sure the page looks decent on different screen sizes

Introduction to UX (User Experience) design — I tried to make the page simple, clean, and easy to navigate

Understanding how important consistency and readability are when it comes to web interfaces

## 🎨 UX & Design Focus
Although it's a beginner project, I paid special attention to user-friendly layout and visual clarity:

Easy-to-read font and clear hierarchy of content

Simple color palette that supports readability and appeal

Buttons and sections laid out logically for smooth navigation

## 🔧 Tech Used
HTML5

CSS3
